 ## Problem Statement

Build a Machine Learning (ML) explainer application that allows users to understand how ML models make predictions. The application should be built using Flask, a Python microframework. The design should include the HTML files needed for the application along with different routes.

## Design

The ML explainer application will consist of the following HTML files:

* `index.html`: The home page of the application. This page will contain a brief introduction to the application and links to the other pages.
* `model.html`: This page will allow users to select a pre-trained ML model to use for making predictions.
* `data.html`: This page will allow users to upload a dataset to use for making predictions.
* `predictions.html`: This page will display the predictions made by the ML model.
* `explanations.html`: This page will display explanations for the predictions made by the ML model.

The application will also have the following routes:

* `/`: The home page of the application.
* `/model`: The page that allows users to select a pre-trained ML model to use for making predictions.
* `/data`: The page that allows users to upload a dataset to use for making predictions.
* `/predictions`: The page that displays the predictions made by the ML model.
* `/explanations`: The page that displays explanations for the predictions made by the ML model.

## Implementation

The ML explainer application can be implemented using Flask, a Python microframework. The following code shows the implementation of the application:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/model')
def model():
    return render_template('model.html')

@app.route('/data')
def data():
    return render_template('data.html')

@app.route('/predictions')
def predictions():
    # Load the data
    data = pd.read_csv(request.files['data'])

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, data['target'], test_size=0.25)

    # Train the model
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate the accuracy
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    # Return the predictions and accuracy
    return render_template('predictions.html', predictions=y_pred, accuracy=accuracy)

@app.route('/explanations')
def explanations():
    # Load the data
    data = pd.read_csv(request.files['data'])

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, data['target'], test_size=0.25)

    # Train the model
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate the accuracy
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    # Get the feature importances
    feature_importances = model.coef_[0]

    # Return the predictions, accuracy, and feature importances
    return render_template('explanations.html', predictions=y_pred, accuracy=accuracy, feature_importances=feature_importances)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Testing

The ML explainer application can be tested by running the following commands:

```
$ python app.py
$ curl http://localhost:5000/
$ curl http://localhost:5000/model
$ curl http://localhost:5000/data
$ curl http://localhost:5000/predictions
$ curl http://localhost:5000/explanations
```

The output of these commands should be the HTML pages for the application.
